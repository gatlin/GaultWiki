title: Labor
...

Labor simply means tasks performed by the members for the house each week. An example might be gardening, or maintenance, or even organizing weekly community events. **Labor is the backbone of a house.** By spending time for the house and working with your housemates you become invested in the house, which in turn strengthens the community.

# Requirements

Each week, coopers are expected to perform at least 2 hours of labor a week.

# The Bounty System

To keep things nimble La Reunion has a bounty system. The idea is taken from Pearl Street Cooperative. During their winter interim they have relatively few members and less labor to do as a result.

## The mailing list

Everyone who has signed a contract will be on the labor-talk@lareunioncoop.org mailing list. Only members of the coop can see or post messages to the list.

## Bounties

A *bounty* is just a task that could be done for labor. Perhaps it's cooking lunch. Perhaps it's cleaning out the gutters. There are multitudes of possibilities. Anyone may post bounties to the list. A bounty consists of a task description and estimated time to completion.

The Labor Czar will respond to each bounty with a verdict or adjustment. Then, anyone may *claim* the bounty. If the task has been completed to the Czar's satisfaction, then the member will receive credit.

Members may propose bounties they intend to do as well. So if you think of a wonderful project you'd like to receive credit for, by all means post a message to the list.

## No-shows

If someone promises to perform a labor task and fails, then someone may *no-show* the negligent member. A no-show is a declaration that labor was not performed, or not performed well. Discussion about the no-show should happen in the resulting email thread. The Czar will render a verdict on the no-show at some point in the thread; there may continue to be appeals.

If a no-show is upheld then the person who was no-showed will owe the house the number of hours promised.

## Make up labor

If you would like to make up hours owed as a result of a no-show, then talk to the Labor Czar in person or at <labor@lareunioncoop.org> and the Czar will work with you to come up with a plan to make up the hours.

## Fines

On the last calendar day of each month, the czar will tally all no-shows and report to the house how many hours each person owes. When a member moves out, they must either make up all the hours or pay fines (the amount per hour is yet to be determined by the house or the Treasurer).

# Rationale

Right now La Reunion has only a few members and we are still learning what sorts of tasks are recurring, what everyone's skills are, etc. Two hours of labor a week is enough to keep everyone involved with the house while at the same time balancing our busy schedules and being realistic about the variety of tasks to be performed.

# Features of Sasona's labor system which we should talk about

1. Automatic review if too many no-shows are received in a given month.

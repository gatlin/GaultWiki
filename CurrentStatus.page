title: Current Status
...

A lot is changing really fast! Here's a brief list of things that have happened recently:

- **10 March 2013**: We named the house La Reunion!
- **8 March 2013**: We closed on the property.
- **Some time in February**: We finally set up a wiki.
- **May 2012**: Started having regular meetings to plan and start a new house.

But this doesn't tell even a fraction of the story. We are in the beginning of what will hopefully be a long and storied adventure in cooperation. Right now there are tenants who are not members of the cooperative, as we are honoring all existing contracts.

We want to grow and become a vibrant, wide-reaching community, which is why we encourage people to **get involved**.

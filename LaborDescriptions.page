title: Labor Descriptions
...

As per our [Motions]() we decided to adopt the labor positions and descriptions of Sasona as a starting point.

# MEMBERSHIP COORDINATOR

1. Keep the house as close to full occupancy as humanly possible.

2. Advertise! Update our ads on Craigslist every week — EVEN WHEN THE HOUSE IS FULL. Never stop advertising. When you post a craigslist ad, email the link to the house. (Tip: It's a good idea to post flyers at all of the campus coops once a semester. At the very least, all of the campus coops and ICC and College Houses offices should be heavily flyered every May, when students are about to graduate and move on. 

3. Answer emails/questions from prospective members and give them tours when you're around. Learn to recognize scam emails (bad grammar/punctuation, usually from a foreign country, says "advert," claims to be a model or working for some altruistic cause, attaches a picture of a beautiful girl, weird email addresses, obviously didn't read the ad, immediately starts asking about how much rent and deposit to pay, etc). Don't be a sucker. If you aren't sure if an email is a scam, send it to the house for advice.

4. Keep the FAQ updated. Email it out to all prospective members -- it will save you a lot of time answering questions.

5. Keep copies of all of the signed contracts. Make note of when people switch rooms so the Treasurer can figure out their prorated rent.

6. Keep the Member Rents and Dates updated on the wiki. Be aware of whose contract is ending soon, and make sure they renew their contract. If, 6 weeks before their contract ends, they will not guarantee that they will renew their contract, start advertising that their room will open up soon. They can renew their contract at any time then, but if someone signs a contract for the room before they do, then they must either move out or, if other rooms are available, switch rooms. If their contract is not renewed a month before the end of the contract period, then advertise their room and let someone else sign for their room (after first giving them a chance). (See: ContractSigningPolicies)

7. Jack's Law: Make sure that new members pay their deposit/membership fee when they sign their contract. If they do not pay their deposit, then they cannot sign a contract. DO NOT let people move in if they haven't paid their deposit.

8. Make sure that people with no money and no job don't move in. It is easier to stop them from moving in than it is to evict them once they're here. People without jobs should pay both the deposit and first month's rent before moving in. If they cannot do so, then that is firsthand knowledge of a reason that they would be evicted -- and therefore a good reason to deny them membership.

9. Keep track of who attended two meetings and when. Keep the Waiting List on the wiki updated. After a prospective member has been accepted, add them to the email list. Keep track of what prospective members have pets, and ensure that the house pet limit is not exceeded.

10. If several people are interested in the same room, decide who gets it. Be very familiar with the Member Acceptance Policy, and follow it faithfully. Update the Member Acceptance Policy, with the house's help, if you encounter situations that the policy does not adequately handle.

11. Keep extra copies of all of the room keys. Keep them organized. With the maintenance coordinator's help, make sure that everyone has a key and a functional lock on their door.

12. Find hostelers to fill vacant rooms until a long-term member can be found. Ask prospective hostelers for more information about themselves (such as a Facebook page) and ask them to explain why they would be a good fit for the house. Accept or reject potential hostelers based on who can take the room when it is available, who will stay the longest (in order to bring in the most money with the least turnover), and who will be the best fit for the house. Do not accept hostelers who won't be a good fit for the house. If there is any question whether someone will be a good fit for the house, contact the house and ask the house's opinion. Hostelers should be civil, friendly, able to pay in advance, and able to move out when their hosteling stay is completed. (See: HostelingPolicies.)

13. Determine how much a member's deposit will be charged upon move-out. (See: DepositReturnPolicies.)

14. Act as House Mediator to try to solve conflicts. Encourage everyone to play nice. (See: MediationInfo)

15. Maintain the "info" email address. Answer emails in a timely manner. Ensure that the Steward knows the password and has access to the "info" account. 

# MAINTENANCE COORDINATOR

1. Keep a running maintenance request list clearly posted.

2. Work with people on maintenance team to keep house in running order.

3. Teach people how to fix basic problems themselves... like clogged faucet, running toilet, etc.

4. Communicate with treasurer and bookkeeper when larger projects requiring significant funds are being planned. Keep track of how much money is left in the maintenance fund, and budget accordingly. Spend money frugally so that there will be some Minor Maintenance money left near the end of the fiscal year. Be aware of and follow NASCO Properties' policies on spending Major Maintenance money; communicate with NASCO Properties before spending Major Maintenance money. (See: MaintenanceBudget.)

5. Turn in receipts to the Treasurer within 24 hours of making a purchase. Use the CHEA Tax ID number to make tax-exempt purchases. (See: SpendingPolicies.)

6. Communicate with house to ensure that the maintenance projects being performed are both wanted and needed. Request house-level input (e.g. emailing the entire house, discussing it at a meeting, or calling an informal meeting for discussion) for non-routine and/or aesthetic decisions. Request and encourage house input, and work to facilitate the needs and interests of the members.

7. Report weekly to the house on what the maintenance crew is doing.

8. Work with Labor Czar and Grounds Coordinator to plan effective and efficient labor holidays. Communicate with the house to determine what the house wants to accomplish on the labor holiday.

9. Ensure that AC filters are changed when needed.

# TREASURER

1. Take a leading role in helping the house create an annual budget. Seek and encourage input from the membership. Create at least three options to propose to the house, by changing the amounts of the food budget, reserve fund, rent, or other variables as needed to provide some options to choose from. The budget should be based on comparisons of actual income and spending compared to the previous budget, and on the coop's income relative to the price of comparable housing. (See: TheBudget.)

2. Ensure the house follows that budget by keeping records of what spending occurs in what budget categories, and comparing the actual spending with the budgeted amounts at least twice a year.

3. Keep track of deposits, credits, money owed to us, and money we owe.

4. Ensure that deposits are made in time to pay all bills.

5. Pay all our rent and bills in full and on time.

6. Collect maintenance receipts from the Maintenance Coordinator. Send receipts to NASCO Properties as needed to ensure we have enough money in our accounts.

7. Maintain an efficient and convenient bank account for the house. Ensure that the account is as resistant to embezzlement as possible.

8. Answer financial questions from the membership. Encourage input from the membership.

9. Provide a public place for the filing of house financial documents. Ensure that all deposit slips and bank statements are filed in a public place within the house on at least a monthly basis.

10. Along with the Bookkeeper, maintain the lockbox for rent payments, receipts, and other documents that need to be secured.

11. When handing out checks, ensure that the person responsible for the check is named in the memo slot for accountability. Any checks that are lost or stolen can therefore be the responsibility of the person to whom the check was issued, so make sure that the carriers of checks are aware of this and take care of the checks they are issued. Ensure that the house Spending Policies are followed (See: SpendingPolicies).

12. Maintain needed publicly accessible calendars of financial deadlines. These should include a monthly calendar for the benefit of the members showing the incoming and outgoing house funds (rent due dates, and due dates of bills). These should also contain a yearly calendar containing information on IRS filing deadlines, the start and end of our Fiscal Year, annual reports due to lenders, the NASCO Properties Fiscal Year (and therefore maintenance expense deadlines) and any other annual information. (See: FinancialCalendar.)

13. Cash is never, ever to be accepted from any members. Ever. Cash has no paper trail and is far too easy to steal. Accept only checks and money orders.

14. Ensure that the Bookkeeper sends out Bookkeeper reports twice a month.

15. Get a copy of the books from the Bookkeeper every two weeks (shortly after the 7th and 15th of the month) to ensure that everyone is up to date on their rent payments and payment plans. Examine the books to ensure that they are accurate and complete, checking accuracy of account balances and assuring that late fees and labor fines were assessed, before returning them to the Bookkeeper.

16. If someone owes more than $100 after the 15th of the month, put them on a payment plan. Work with the member so that they have a workable payment plan that fits their budget. Follow the Payment Plan Policies. (See: PaymentPlans.) Email approved payment plans to the house.

17. As soon as someone falls off their payment plan—if their rent is late, or their payment plan installment is late—alert the Steward. The Steward will then deliver the Elliot Blanton Memorial Eviction Notice.

18. Ensure that taxes are filed accurately and on time. Be familiar with tax filing procedures. (See: TaxFilingInformation.)

19. Serve on the Board of Directors and attend all relevant meetings.

20. Uphold the Open Books Policy. (See: OpenBooksPolicy.) Upon request, show any current member the bookkeeping records, bank account statements, deposit slips, and any other financial information that is requested, including how money is spent and what members owe money, who is facing eviction, who is on a payment plan, etc.

21. Ensure that all house bank accounts are on Mint.com (or a comparable program that allows members to view financial activity). Ensure that all current members have access to the accounts on mint.com. Fill in the primary account's spending categories monthly on mint.com so that the membership knows what each expense was for.

22. Report monthly on utilities expenses, including comparisons with previous year and with budgeted amount.

23. Ensure that NASCO membership dues are paid on time. (See: NascoMemberDues.)

24. Write deposit return checks to members who are moving out, after being informed of the amount by the Membership Coordinator. (See: DepositReturnPolicies.)

25. Communicate with the Labor Czar every month to ensure that labor fines are being assessed in a timely manner (see LaborPolicies). If this job is not being completed, no-show the Labor Czar.

26. If a new Bookkeeper is elected during your term, help to train them. (See: BookkeeperTrainingChecklist.)

27. When stepping down from the position, train the new Treasurer. (See: TreasurerTrainingChecklist.) Do whatever needs to be done to assist in removing yourself as a signor on the bank account. If you are moving out, your deposit will not be returned until you have removed yourself as a signor. 

# LABOR CZARISTA / CZAR

1. Plan and post the labor schedule for each week. Maintain running no-show sheet with who was no-showed, what for, no-show-er, and action taken to resolve the situation.

2. Maintain a running tally of each individual house members number of no-shows and make-up hours owed. Penalize no-shows according to The Machine (see LaborPolicies). Maintain a publicly available format of each house member's no-shows, make-up labor hours owed, make-up labor hours completed, and labor fines owed; update this spreadsheet every month when make-up labor is assessed and labor fines are assessed. Follow the Labor Fine Policy (see LaborPolicies). When assessing make-up labor hours, email them to the house. When assessing labor fines, email them to the house, the Treasurer, and the Bookkeeper. When a member exceeds the evictable limit for no-shows, inform the Steward.

3. Maintain and update labor descriptions.

4. Mediate between no-show-ers and the no-showed when possible. Communicate with house via meetings when no-shower/no-showed can’t come to a solution.

5. Work with maintenance coordinator and grounds crew coordinator to plan labor holidays.

6. Run house elections

7. Update the HouseOfficers wiki page within a week of any change in officers. For each position, list the name of the person holding the position, the date of their first election, the date of their most recent election, the date of the next election, and any other relevant information.

title: Labor Descriptions
...

As per our [Motions]() we decided to adopt the labor positions and descriptions of Sasona as a starting point.

# MEMBERSHIP COORDINATOR

1. Keep the house as close to full occupancy as humanly possible.

2. Advertise! Update our ads on Craigslist every week â€” EVEN WHEN THE HOUSE IS FULL. Never stop advertising. When you post a craigslist ad, email the link to the house. (Tip: It's a good idea to post flyers at all of the campus coops once a semester. At the very least, all of the campus coops and ICC and College Houses offices should be heavily flyered every May, when students are about to graduate and move on. 

3. Answer emails/questions from prospective members and give them tours when you're around. Learn to recognize scam emails (bad grammar/punctuation, usually from a foreign country, says "advert," claims to be a model or working for some altruistic cause, attaches a picture of a beautiful girl, weird email addresses, obviously didn't read the ad, immediately starts asking about how much rent and deposit to pay, etc). Don't be a sucker. If you aren't sure if an email is a scam, send it to the house for advice.

4. Keep the FAQ updated. Email it out to all prospective members -- it will save you a lot of time answering questions.

5. Keep copies of all of the signed contracts. Make note of when people switch rooms so the Treasurer can figure out their prorated rent.

6. Keep the Member Rents and Dates updated on the wiki. Be aware of whose contract is ending soon, and make sure they renew their contract. If, 6 weeks before their contract ends, they will not guarantee that they will renew their contract, start advertising that their room will open up soon. They can renew their contract at any time then, but if someone signs a contract for the room before they do, then they must either move out or, if other rooms are available, switch rooms. If their contract is not renewed a month before the end of the contract period, then advertise their room and let someone else sign for their room (after first giving them a chance). (See: ContractSigningPolicies)

7. Jack's Law: Make sure that new members pay their deposit/membership fee when they sign their contract. If they do not pay their deposit, then they cannot sign a contract. DO NOT let people move in if they haven't paid their deposit.

8. Make sure that people with no money and no job don't move in. It is easier to stop them from moving in than it is to evict them once they're here. People without jobs should pay both the deposit and first month's rent before moving in. If they cannot do so, then that is firsthand knowledge of a reason that they would be evicted -- and therefore a good reason to deny them membership.

9. Keep track of who attended two meetings and when. Keep the Waiting List on the wiki updated. After a prospective member has been accepted, add them to the email list. Keep track of what prospective members have pets, and ensure that the house pet limit is not exceeded.

10. If several people are interested in the same room, decide who gets it. Be very familiar with the Member Acceptance Policy, and follow it faithfully. Update the Member Acceptance Policy, with the house's help, if you encounter situations that the policy does not adequately handle.

11. Keep extra copies of all of the room keys. Keep them organized. With the maintenance coordinator's help, make sure that everyone has a key and a functional lock on their door.

12. Find hostelers to fill vacant rooms until a long-term member can be found. Ask prospective hostelers for more information about themselves (such as a Facebook page) and ask them to explain why they would be a good fit for the house. Accept or reject potential hostelers based on who can take the room when it is available, who will stay the longest (in order to bring in the most money with the least turnover), and who will be the best fit for the house. Do not accept hostelers who won't be a good fit for the house. If there is any question whether someone will be a good fit for the house, contact the house and ask the house's opinion. Hostelers should be civil, friendly, able to pay in advance, and able to move out when their hosteling stay is completed. (House vote, 12-6-09.) (See: HostelingPolicies.)

13. Determine how much a member's deposit will be charged upon move-out. (See: DepositReturnPolicies.)

14. Act as House Mediator to try to solve conflicts. Encourage everyone to play nice. (See: MediationInfo)

15. Maintain the "info" email address. Answer emails in a timely manner. Ensure that the Steward knows the password and has access to the "info" account. 

# MAINTENANCE COORDINATOR

1. Keep a running maintenance request list clearly posted.

2. Work with people on maintenance team to keep house in running order.

3. Teach people how to fix basic problems themselves... like clogged faucet, running toilet, etc.

4. Communicate with treasurer and bookkeeper when larger projects requiring significant funds are being planned. Keep track of how much money is left in the maintenance fund, and budget accordingly. Spend money frugally so that there will be some Minor Maintenance money left near the end of the fiscal year. Be aware of and follow NASCO Properties' policies on spending Major Maintenance money; communicate with NASCO Properties before spending Major Maintenance money. (See: MaintenanceBudget.)

5. Turn in receipts to the Treasurer within 24 hours of making a purchase. Use the CHEA Tax ID number to make tax-exempt purchases. (See: SpendingPolicies.)

6. Communicate with house to ensure that the maintenance projects being performed are both wanted and needed. Request house-level input (e.g. emailing the entire house, discussing it at a meeting, or calling an informal meeting for discussion) for non-routine and/or aesthetic decisions. Request and encourage house input, and work to facilitate the needs and interests of the members.

7. Report weekly to the house on what the maintenance crew is doing.

8. Work with Labor Czar and Grounds Coordinator to plan effective and efficient labor holidays. Communicate with the house to determine what the house wants to accomplish on the labor holiday.

9. Ensure that AC filters are changed when needed.

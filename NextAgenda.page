Agenda For 5/11

1.  (Nolan)  Discussion of violence in our community.

2.  (Hannah)  Agenda items must be added the Friday before the meeting by midnight to be voted on.  Items added after this point can be discussed as new business but not voted on.

3.  (Hannah)  Set associate membership at $60 per month, with one month's dues as deposit and $50 nonrefundable membership fee to be paid before a contract is signed.  Associates may vote, run for office, and access all community resources as other members but may not sleep on the property except under occasional, extenuating circumstances or if they are the guest of another member in their unit.  If the member shares their unit with another member the other member must not object to the associate sleeping in the unit.

Agenda For 5/19

1.  (Donny) Discuss ideas for constructing a sustainable Maintenance team

2.  (Hannah)Vote on proposal for definition of and policies for associate membership ([available here.]())  

3.  (Hannah)Do we want to continue to use common space as transitional housing for members wanting to live here permanently?  Accepted prospective members Paul and Azurra are interested in this.

4.  (Hannah)One resident whose lease is expiring at the end of this month has a lease approved for renewal by HACA at the rate of $695 a month.  This was approved before CHEA bought the building.  If HACA does allow us to change it will take several months and seems unfair to this resident to change the deal, even though ownership has changed.  Vote to approve allowing this lease rate to stand for the tenant's lease term to come and to absorb losses from the vacancy fund.

5.  (Hannah)Discussion of whether and how to allow in-kind donations of food to food program in place of $50/month dues.

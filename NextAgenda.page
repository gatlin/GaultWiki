1. (Gatlin) Amend Labor Czar description to state the following:

    1. Plan and post the labor schedule for each week. Maintain running no-show sheet with who was no-showed, what for, no-show-er, 
       and action taken to resolve the situation.
    
    2. Maintain a running tally of each individual house members number of no-shows and make-up hours owed. Penalize no-shows 
       according to The Machine (see LaborPolicies). Maintain a publicly available format of each house member's no-shows, make-up 
       labor hours owed, make-up labor hours completed, and labor fines owed; update this spreadsheet every month when make-up labor 
       is assessed and labor fines are assessed. Follow the Labor Fine Policy (see LaborPolicies). When assessing make-up labor hours, 
       email them to the house. When assessing labor fines, email them to the house, the Treasurer, and the Bookkeeper. When a member 
       exceeds the evictable limit for no-shows, inform the Steward. (house vote, 1/27/13)
    
    3. Maintain and update labor descriptions.
    
    4. Mediate between no-show-ers and the no-showed when possible. Communicate with house via meetings when no-shower/no-showed canâ€™t 
       come to a solution.
    
    5. Work with maintenance coordinator and grounds crew coordinator to plan labor holidays.
    
    6. Run house elections.
    
    7. Ensure that all labor matters are accessible and available to all members of the cooperative regardless of ability or means  
       of communication.

1.  (Hannah) Require a lease rate of $850 per unit or $450 per room for all new tenants signing contracts, in order to fund meal plan.  Current tenants can choose to opt in or maintain their lease at its current rate without the food program, indefinitely.

2.  (Donny) Discuss options for moving forward on the A/C replacement project for 204 and perhaps beyond. We have some bids now. Discuss whether we want to try to replace any before they break, and if so, a policy for how many and which ones.

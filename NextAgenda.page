1. (Gatlin) Amend Labor Czar description to state the following:

    1. Plan and post the labor schedule for each week. Maintain running faux pas sheet with who was indicted, what for, the plaintiff, 
       and action taken to resolve the situation.
    
    2. Maintain a running tally of each individual house members number of no-shows and make-up hours owed. Penalize faux pas' 
       according to house policy. Maintain a publicly available format of each house member's faux pas', make-up 
       labor hours owed, make-up labor hours completed, and labor fines owed; update this spreadsheet every month when make-up labor 
       is assessed and labor fines are assessed. Follow the any fine policy the house chooses. When assessing make-up labor hours, 
       email them to the house. When assessing labor fines, email them to the house, the Treasurer, and the Bookkeeper. When a member 
       exceeds the evictable limit for faux pas', inform the house.
    
    3. Create and maintain labor descriptions.
    
    4. Mediate between faux pas plaintiffs and defendants when possible. Communicate with house via meetings when plaintiff/defendant
       canâ€™t come to a solution.
    
    5. Work with house officers to plan labor holidays.
    
    6. Run house elections according to applicable policy.
    
    7. Ensure that all labor matters are accessible and available to all members of the cooperative regardless of ability or means  
       of communication.

2. (Gatlin) Move to make the [following amendments to the CHEA bylaws][bylawchanges]. *This was passed at Sasona. If two houses each support a bylaw amendment with at least 60% majority, then the amendment passes.*

3. (Gatlin) Move to adopt the following policy for membership dues:

    1. Dues are to be deposited on or before the 7th of the month, or they are considered late.
    2. If a member's dues are late, they will incur a $25 fine on top of their dues.
    3. If dues are not deposited on or before the 15th of the month then the offending member is liable for immediate eviction.
    4. If a member is evicted for late dues, the member may appeal this at a house meeting within 7 days of the eviction; the eviction
       may be overturned by a simple majority decision.

1. (Gatlin) Amend Labor Czar description to state the following:

    1. Plan and post the labor schedule for each week. Maintain running faux pas sheet with who was indicted, what for, the plaintiff, 
       and action taken to resolve the situation.
    
    2. Maintain a running tally of each individual house members number of no-shows and make-up hours owed. Penalize faux pas' 
       according to house policy. Maintain a publicly available format of each house member's faux pas', make-up 
       labor hours owed, make-up labor hours completed, and labor fines owed; update this spreadsheet every month when make-up labor 
       is assessed and labor fines are assessed. Follow the any fine policy the house chooses. When assessing make-up labor hours, 
       email them to the house. When assessing labor fines, email them to the house, the Treasurer, and the Bookkeeper. When a member 
       exceeds the evictable limit for faux pas', inform the house.
    
    3. Create and maintain labor descriptions.
    
    4. Mediate between faux pas plaintiffs and defendants when possible. Communicate with house via meetings when plaintiff/defendant
       canâ€™t come to a solution.
    
    5. Work with house officers to plan labor holidays.
    
    6. Run house elections according to applicable policy.
    
    7. Ensure that all labor matters are accessible and available to all members of the cooperative regardless of ability or means  
       of communication.

2. (Gatlin) Move to make the [following amendments to the CHEA bylaws][bylawchanges]. *This was passed at Sasona. If two houses each support a bylaw amendment with at least 60% majority, then the amendment passes.*

3. (Gatlin) Move to adopt the following policy for membership dues:

    1. Dues are to be deposited on or before the 7th of the month, or they are considered late.
    2. If a member's dues are late, they will incur a $25 fine on top of their dues.
    3. If dues are not deposited on or before the 15th of the month then the offending member is liable for immediate eviction.
    4. If a member is evicted for late dues, the member may appeal this at a house meeting within 7 days of the eviction; the eviction
       may be overturned by a simple majority decision.

4.  (Hannah) What do we want out of our food program?  I want to take the following straw polls of all present who are or intend to become members:

-Assuming the cost of $50/month and two hours of labor, would you join the food co-op?
 
-Do you want a food co-op that collaborates to serve meals, as opposed to strictly buying food in bulk?
 
-Do you think this program should be mandatory, including to people who live here now that want to renew their contract?  
 
-Do you think the food program should be mandatory for all new contracts? (Which would include co-opers since our  current leases only go until June 30th)
 

5.  (Hannah) McAllen wants to sign a lease to begin May 1 with his first month's rent on a payment plan.  Payment plans at Sasona must be put on schedule to be paid by the end of the lease.  In order to make this a viable option, McAllen would need to sign a 6 or 12 month lease.  However, as discussed, we do not have a permanent lease document yet.  Should I have him sign our current lease, with the understanding that its terms are $800/month, does not mandate participation in a food program, and that both these matters are currently under discussion?

6.  (Hannah)  Allow current tenants to sign leases as co-op members under their current lease payment amounts until the end of their current lease period, if they attend two meetings and agree to labor commitment.

7. (Gatlin) Move to discount Gatlin's and Greg's April dues by 50% as they were not able to live in it.

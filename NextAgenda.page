Agenda For 6/23

1.  (Hannah) Approve Grounds Coordinator labor description.

2.  (Erin) Have a Reunion Housewarming party on Sat. July 20th from 6:30 pm until Reunion kiddos need to go to sleep.

3.  (Erin) Allow Associate Member Erin Bannen to use her marketing background to run a fundraising campaign to raise money to make Reunion's building better. The house officers and house itself will decide what the money will be spent on, and who will be doing the work, before the campaign is launched. If Erin raises the amount of money decided upon, she will be awarded 1 year free membership with no labor. 

4.  (Hannah)  In the event of our next vacancy do we want to continue generating income from renting out the common space, or phasing out the renting of common rooms?

1. Hammer out the details for engagement with current residents and a *specific* timeline as our first agenda item, with a goal of deploying some outreach teams next week.

2. Rent for people moving in

3. Deposit amounts and (assuming we know the full details of the loan and NP's lease payment amounts by then) RENT.

4. Set up the Google phone for maintenance requests, and put its number on the [Tenants Letter](). (Donny)

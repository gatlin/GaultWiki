title: CHEA Expansion Meeting Minutes for 06/19
...

Here are the notes from Tuesday's meeting. Thank you Mike Gorse for
contributing your notes, and lots of thanks to everyone who participated!

I've done some editing of the original notes taken, mainly by summarizing
them. In the Community Outreach section I gave a summary paragraph of the
info we discussed followed what people said. Some of what I wrote in this
paragraph is underlined. These portions of it are parts of what we've
discussed as being our core goals, or principles.
I didn't think to record the names of the people who spoke as I was taking
notes, so many of the discussion points I've denoted with question marks at
the beginning. Mike included your names in his notes and so some of the
discussion points have them.
The action items also don't have names assigned to them except for the ones
I volunteered for. I apologize for any confusion. Please look over the
action items and choose which ones you'd like to take on. *
*I put a couple of things in parenthesis. These are questions I had after
reading the notes, for things that I feel need some further clarification.*
*Everyone please feel free to add any thoughts you may have.*


# Viability and next steps concerning the Tillery Property

## Property Details

* Good location (Airport and Manor), parks, HEB, rapidly developing
neighborhood
* Huge back yard. Room to build another building. Almost an acre of land.
* An old house built in the 30's, divided into two units (maybe 3/4 bedrooms
each, with a lot of extra living rooms)
* Another building with a series of two 2-bedroom apartments flanked by a
1-bedroom apartment
* Chicken coop
* Lots of parking

*Clifford*: Code requires a certain egris(sp?) size since, if the window is
too small, you can't get out in a fire

*Jay*: Should check with the development assistance center. If there's a
floor plan, you might be able to find it there.

*Clifford*: When you get serious about a property, talk to the development
assistance center. They will write you up a land use opinion regarding your
proposed use.


*# Action Items

*-McAllen*: Get the property's info package from Matt, see if it includes
the floor plan

-Get the following info from the floor plan
* Find out the window size specification in the one-window-per-bedroom
rule
* Ventilation
* Room access

-Contact the Dept of Neighborhood Planning to see how zoning would work in
JJ Seabrook nieghborhood

    Get the exact definitions of MF-2 & MF-4 (does Daniel Miller know them?)

*-McAllen*: Survey the property values in the area, ask Matt for this info

*-McAllen*: Ask Matt about other prospective buyers looking at the property

-Contact N Assoc. (do we need to do this now or later down the road?)

-Discuss the feasability of pooling our own funds for a property
downpayment and lending those funds to NP. This would expidite our ability
to buy a place.


# Community Outreach

One of our goals for the new coop is to* welcome people of diverse
backgrounds.* The student and independent coops in Austin collectively have
already gone far in* welcoming people of different age groups and sexual
orientations*. We hope to broaden this range of coopers even further
by*reaching out to people of differing economic, racial and political
backgrounds.* Another goal is to *provide affordable housing,* we will want
to keep this in mind as we shop for properties, especially since we want to
invite people from lower-income brackets.

*Gatlyn*: Some people get turned off by the hippie vibe. If we explain that
it's for everybody, hippie-haters might not turn it down.

*McAllen*: I'd like to get to know people in commnity/civic/religious
organizations who have our same core values. They would make great coopers,
we should start to get to know them and see if they'd be interested. An
example of one such organization is a nation-wide service organization
affiliated with Americorps called City Year. I worked with them in
Philadelphia providing tutoring and after school programs to at-risk youth
in low-income neighborhoods. The 160 members were made up of a highkly
diverse group of people from around the country ranging from rural and
urban working class people to college-educated people from a range of
economic backgrounds. It also included several people who grew up in the
very communities that we served.

*Jay*: What is the diversity of the Tillery St neighborhood?

*??*: The demographic is changing.

*??*: That raises the stakes. We're either going to be actively
participating in gentrification, or we'll be providing an alternative that
embraces a changing city with a certain amount of fairness. If we get a
property in east Austin or any other area with a significant changing
population, maybe we can reserve a certain number of places for people from
the neighborhood.

*??*: I was thinking of actively seeking out people who have been there for
a long time to be part of our coop.

*??: *Almost all the coops in Austin are in high-income areas. Even if the
students in WC aren't, their parents are. The average room rate in Sasona
is about the same as in College Houses. That is low for Barton Hills and
West Campus but incredibly high for rest of Austin/Texas. Will make
diversity easier if this coop is truly affordable. Hit that 450 mark and
you'll get a lot of diversity. Directly because, honestly, we're the ones
who can afford to live in coops right now. If we can make it easier, it
democratizes it. We're here because we can afford it.

*??*: Income-qualified people. With student coops, your income is your
parents' income. Could reserve a certain amount of rooms for people at a
certain level of income.

??*: I think that income qualification is a good stick to measure by, but
would be hesitant to put in other kinds of quotas. Could end up with an
artificial diversity. The coop should be harmonious. We'd have a lot of
artificial things in place, and wouldn't be real. Would not want it to be a
precedent for setting other quotas.

*Jessie*: Coops are a seed, like NASCO is seeding us, the same way that ICC
got started. To increase affordable housing, 4 rooms, 2 rooms in one house
isn't the way you do it. By creating these coops, making this a default
option for people seeking a place to live, rather than just an apartment or
a house. We'll have to do a lot more than setting aside a couple of rooms.
We need to put in something in the charter saying that it's something CHEA
wants to contribute.

*Mollie*: Maybe we could go back to the original history of coop housing.
Was providing housing and also services. Could actively recruit members
from neighborhood orgs but also actively recruit people to be from the
neighborhood, recruit "associates" from the neighborhood and strongly
invest in a community-style garden. Could address certain essential
problems in poor neighborhoods while avoiding the quandary you brought up.

*Clifford*: When we start mentioning associate memberships, that's when
zoning kicks back in.

*??*: We will definitely need MF-4 zoning if we want to have associate
members. An alternative option is to set up something similar to "internet
cafes" in which a service that's unrelated to the official organization or
business is provided unofficially.
**This is my interpretation of what I heard about this idea btw. Whoever
brought it up, please feel free to clarify or edit it as necessary.*

*Donnie*: Back on the affordability track, sort of a problem that's solved
for us if we're a CHEA house, is CHEA is a 501c3 largely because it'
written in its charter. There is income-testing for CHEA. If we raise the
rents too much, it's not even raising the rents, if we have too many rich
people, we'd be at risk of losing tax-exempt status.

*Mike*: May want to have income criteria more aggressive than what the
charter calls for.

*??*: Austin Free Skool would love a place to take classes.

*McAllen*: Having associate members, a community garden, and allowing the
Austin Free Skool to come and do activities are all examples of another one
of our core goals which is to* **have our coop be a venue for activities
that are fun, educational, and support community development.*

# Action Items

* Explore CHEA's income qualification requirements.
* Recruit associates from the neighborhood to move in when we're set up.
* Provide services, community gardens etc.
* *McAllen*: Compile a list of community/civic/religious orgs in Austin that
we'd be interested in visiting to find people interested in being members,
associates, or participating in our future projects.
(Is anyone else interested in doing a little research and finding these
organizations in Austin that sound like good candidates?)

# Research Proposal

*Hannah*: I'd like to make a quick survey to send out to folks involved in
the project, current co-op members, and possibly folks on the Sasona
waiting list to see what qualities/assets/facilities/attitudes they'd want
in their ideal community.  It would be cool to have some help brainstorming
useful questions to ask.

(Did we come up with any questions at the meeting, or did we decide to
think of the questions afterward and send them to you?)

# Other

(Does anyone object to removing Matt Robb from the discussion list? We
discussed this but I don't remember what we decided exactly. Daniel Miller
brought up the point that real estate agents aren't normally privy to the
kinds of information that we're discussing amongst ourselves as a coop
planning group. This isn't a reflection the character or intentions  of he
and his business partners whatsoever, but is merely an issue of the most
appropriate protocol for our discussion. If we agree to remove him I'd like
to just delete his name from the group and then go back to forwarding the
property listings he sends me - I feel that this would be the easiest thing
to do, unless anyone feels differently.)

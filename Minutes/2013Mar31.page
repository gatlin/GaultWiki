Discussion of meet and greet event with residents on April 7.

Greg and Victor are designated as grillmeisters.
Hannah:  Someone should make a flyer.
McAllen volunteers
Victor:  We should also have some sort of handout sheet.
Hannah:  I'd like to balance a presentation with a conversation type of atmosphere. Maybe start with a round robin, break into small groups afterward.
Travis:  People will probably expect some sort of presentation.  They'll expect to have information organized and delivered.  NASCO has resources for explaining co-ops in this kind of situation.
Nolan:  We need to emphasize the cooperative nature of the culture we're creating, as well.
McAllen:  We should also think about designing an orientation once people do join.

Hannah, McAllen, and Nolan volunteer for organizing committee for this event.

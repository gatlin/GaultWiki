In lieu of a comprehensive, sectioned, formatted list of house rules, this page houses all motions passed at various meetings which affect policy. This will be organized into a house policy manual in short order.

# Meeting Chair position

> Motion (Gatlin/Donny) to elect a meeting chair at the next meeting. Term is 12 weeks. Responsibility: to facilitate discussions by enforcing standing rules, appoint a minutes taker at each meeting, make sure the minutes are made publicly available to all committee members, lead a group approval of the prior meeting’s minutes as an understood first agenda item at each meeting, and manage a stack if necessary; there is an understanding that this is a bootstrapping measure in need of review.

> **Everyone is cool again!**

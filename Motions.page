In lieu of a comprehensive, sectioned, formatted list of house rules, this page houses all motions passed at various meetings which affect policy. This will be organized into a house policy manual in short order.

# Quorum

> Motion (Gatlin/Trip) to require 3 members present to have a meeting, two of whom are CHEA Board members.

> **Everyone is “cool with that.”**

[Minutes/2012Nov09]()

# Supermajority

> Motion (Gatlin/Donny) to pass [proposal to require a supermajority for all decisions except new members; new member votes require a simple majority], with the intention that we will scrutinize membership policies again soon.

> **Passes by consensus.**

[Minutes/2012Nov09]()

# Meeting Chair position

> Motion (Gatlin/Donny) to elect a meeting chair at the next meeting. Term is 12 weeks. Responsibility: to facilitate discussions by enforcing standing rules, appoint a minutes taker at each meeting, make sure the minutes are made publicly available to all committee members, lead a group approval of the prior meeting’s minutes as an understood first agenda item at each meeting, and manage a stack if necessary; there is an understanding that this is a bootstrapping measure in need of review.

> **Everyone is cool again!**

[Minutes/2012Nov09]()

> *Friendly amendment to prior motion*: “The facilitator is expected to routinely offer and encourage other members to take on the role of meeting facilitation, but is available as a backup resource if no member volunteers.”

> **McAllen is elected as meeting chair.**

[Minutes/2012Dec06]()

# Governance Structure

> - Each committee will have an elected facilitator
> - Committees are expected to meet twice a month
> - The first committee you join you get labor credit for, any labor credit for additional committees is up to the labor czar
> - The system will have a 3 month probationary period upon implementation. Subject to review, if the system doesn't serve the coop well, it will revert to a traditional officer structure.

*Who made the motion and who seconded it?*

title: CHEA Treasury Proposal
...

The State of Texas says we need a corporate treasurer. Additionally, it makes sense for tax and oversight reasons to elect a member to oversee the financial health of CHEA as a whole. However, we want to balance this oversight with authority at each house to manage its own affairs.

As closure on the new house is imminent, it is necessary to iron out details of how the Ministry of Finance will work across multiple houses. This is a proposal from the current CHEA Treasurer.

# CHEA Treasurer

The CHEA Treasurer's job would consist of the following:

- Sit on the Board of Directors and advise on financial matters
- Ensure CHEA's tax return is filed on time
- Work with house bookkeepers to make sure they are collecting their rent

Additionally, the Treasurer would be a co-signor on all house bank accounts as well as any CHEA-level accounts.

# House Bookkeepers

Each house elects a Bookkeeper who has the following responsibilities:

- Collecting rent
- Reporting to the house on financial matters
- Creating the yearly budget, perhaps with assistance from the Treasurer
- Ensure the house is paying its share of the various loans

Additionally, the Bookkeepers would be signors on all their respective house's accounts and all CHEA-level accounts.

# Bank accounts

All accounts are technically CHEA accounts; however, they differ in purpose and access authorization.

## CHEA accounts

CHEA may only have accounts explicitly enumerated in the bylaws. These would be for things like pooling together money to pay NASCO loans or to collect shared maintenance money.

## House accounts

Houses may create accounts for any purpose. For example, Sasona has separate accounts for maintenance and food shopping in addition to regular house expenses. Sasona's Bookkeeper and the Treasurer would be signors on these accounts; nobody else would be.

# Income

All houses are expected to exist off the income of their own members. Houses may of course ask for financial assistance if necessary but otherwise each house is expected to base its budget off of its income alone.

# Credit cards, checks, etc

Houses may have cards for their various accounts. At our current credit union, Velocity, each card must have a specific human name on them, so when the Treasurer changes the cards must all be re-issued. There is currently no way around this.

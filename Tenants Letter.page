# Initial letter to tenants at Gault street

Hello!

We're the Community Housing Expansion of Austin, a non-profit housing organization. Recently we purchased this apartment building with the intention of creating a housing cooperative.

The first thing you should know is that we are going to honor all existing leases. We also intend to create a new kind of living situation and we want to include you in the process.

In a housing cooperative, the residents manage the property themselves. The residents are in charge of making sure rent is paid, how the rent money is spent, performing maintenance tasks, and all of this is decided in group meetings.

But a cooperative does more than just maintain the property. The purpose of a cooperative is to give residents responsibility and ownership of the building. In doing this, we create a community that's more than the sum of its parts. A cooperative supports its residents, and in turn the residents run the cooperative.

If you'd like to stay beyond your current lease and help us create this community, please visit _____nonexistentwebsite_____ to find out more.

Sincerely,

Community Housing Expansion of Austin

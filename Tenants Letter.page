# Initial letter to tenants at Gault street

Hello!

We're the Community Housing Expansion of Austin, a non-profit housing organization. Recently this apartment building was purchased on our behalf with the intention of creating a housing cooperative here.

The first thing you should know is that we are going to honor all existing leases. We also intend to create a new kind of living situation and we want to include you in the process.

In a housing cooperative, the residents manage the property themselves. The residents are in charge of making sure rent is paid, how the rent money is spent, and performing maintenance tasks.  These things are decided in group meetings made up entirely of the residents.

But a cooperative does more than just maintain the property; the purpose of a cooperative is to give residents responsibility and ownership of the building. In doing this, we create a community that's more than the sum of its parts. A cooperative supports its residents, and in turn the residents run the cooperative.

Being a member in a cooperative entails responsibilities such as chores like cleaning and maintenance of the common areas, working together with other members, and participation in the group decision-making process.

If you'd like to stay beyond your current lease and help us create this community, please visit http://chea.niltag.net/ to find out more.

Sincerely,

Community Housing Expansion of Austin

Descriptions
---

Some of these positions are officers and thus are already described in the [OfficerDescriptions]() page.

Maintenance crew
:    Members on maintenance crew are assigned tasks by the Maintenance Coordinator. Often maintenance crew people work in pairs or groups. Some prior knowledge of basic maintenance and tool use is handy.

Grounds
:    Responsible for the general upkeep of the property. Examples include gardening, picking up litter, or painting. People on grounds will receive assignments from the Labor Czar until further notice, though they may propose projects as well.

Minutes taker
:    Responsible for recording the important events and discussions at house meetings.

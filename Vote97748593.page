title: Ballot 21 May 2013
...

Hello anonymous voters! Here's how this will work. Each section is a different position. Under each section will be one or more names of candidates. If you vote for a person, put an X after their name. If two people vote for Joe Blow, then the line would read "Joe Blow X X".

If you prefer to write in your own candidate, then just write a name under "Write-in".

Don't worry about overwriting each other; I'll look at the Recent Activity to see if both of you saved your different copies of the page at different times.

Happy Voting!

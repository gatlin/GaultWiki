# Editing pages

On a given page, just select the "edit" button on the top horizontal menu.

# Markup language

For accessibility, you edit pages in Markdown. There is a reference on the sidebar of the edit pages that I'll probably clean up a bit. In short though I put an example page at the end of this document.

# Creating pages

You can create a page by just making up a title; it'll ask if you want to create a new page. For example, i want to make a page called McAllenTheDragonSlayer.Â 

So I just visit [http://chea.niltag.net/McAllenTheDragonSlayer](http://chea.niltag.net/McAllenTheDragonSlayer) and the wiki will ask if you wish to create it.

# Example page markup

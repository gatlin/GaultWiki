# Editing pages

On a given page, just select the "edit" button on the top horizontal menu.

## Markup language

For accessibility, you edit pages in [Markdown][1]. There is a reference on the sidebar of the edit pages which illustrates a lot of common examples. There is also [an example page](#example-page-markup) in this document.

[Markdown][1] looks a lot like how many people format their emails ([see the end of this page](#example-page-markup)). It is intended that the plain Markdown text looks sort of like the page it will be converted to. Don't think too hard about it.

## Description of changes

You must enter a description of changes before the wiki will let you save. I'm saving you from yourself, I promise.

## Table of Contents

This is automatically generated based on headings. Don't even worry about it!

# Creating pages

You can create a page by just making up a title. For example, I want to make a page called McAllenTheDragonSlayer.Â 

So I just visit [http://lareunioncoop.org/McAllenTheDragonSlayer](http://lareunioncoop.org/McAllenTheDragonSlayer) and the wiki will ask me if I wish to create it. It's that simple.

# Example page markup

Below is example markup. To display unformatted text this way, each line is indented 4 spaces. To display unformatted text, by and by, just put 4 spaces at the beginning of a line.

For more examples, on the side of each page is a link to view "raw page source." It'll show you exactly what was typed up to produce that page. Markdown is very intuitive.

    title: My Page Title
    ...
    
    # Heading 1
    
    Some text. *Some italicized text.*
    
    A new paragraph! And a footnote[^1].
    
    ## Subheading
    
    **Some bolded text.**
    
    ## Another subheading
    
    > I can quote people this way, just like in email.
    
    # Heading 2
    
    - A list item
    - Another
    - final one
    
    # Heading 3 (see the pattern?)
    
    It is also easy to make tables!
    
    ## Simple table
    
    Column 1   Column 2      Column 3
    --------   ------------  --------
    Value 1    Value 2       Value 3
    Value 4    Value 5       Value 6
    
    ## More complex one
    
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    Left aligned heading     Right aligned heading   Centered heading
    ---------------------- -----------------------  ------------------
    Note the extra dashes    Note the extra dashes   Same dash number
    to the right.            to the left             either side!
    
    Note that the markup     for tables looks like   ... a table :)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    And below this is a horizontal rule:
    
    ***
    
    [A link to outside the wiki.](http://google.com)
    
    [Another way to write external links.][1]
    
    [Reference Links don't have to use numebers.][keyword]
    
    [ALinkToAWikiPage]()
    
    [Link to heading 1](#heading-1)
    
    *Note in that last link, "Heading 1" is lowercased and the spaces
    become dashes.*
    
    [1]: http://niltag.net "Optional link title"
    [keyword]: http://gitit.net "See?"
    
    [^1]: Here's the footnote!

## What it looks like

The [ExamplePage]() is what this example markup looks like when turned into a page.

# Discussion pages

If you've used Wikipedia or other wikis, you know usually pages have a "Talk page" or similar. This wiki is no different.

Take any page URL - say, http://chea.niltag.net/McAllenTheDragonSlayer - and put an @ sign in it like so:

    http://chea.niltag.net/@McAllenTheDragonSlayer

And you are now at the "Discussion page." To edit it, first *go* to the Discussion page using the link at the top and *then* select "edit" from there. This page has a Discussion page - try it out!

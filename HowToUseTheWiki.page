# Editing pages

On a given page, just select the "edit" button on the top horizontal menu.

## Markup language

For accessibility, you edit pages in Markdown. There is a reference on the sidebar of the edit pages that I'll probably clean up a bit. In short though I put an example page at the end of this document.

Markdown looks a lot like how many people format their emails (see the end of this page). It is intended that the plain Markdown text looks sort of like the page it will be converted to so it is readable no matter what. Don't think too hard about it.

## Description of changes

I believe you must enter a short description of your changes before it will save. Frankly my Internet has been awful lately so hiccoughs might be on my end.

## Table of Contents

This is automatically generated based on headings. Don't even worry about it!

# Creating pages

You can create a page by just making up a title; it'll ask if you want to create a new page. For example, i want to make a page called McAllenTheDragonSlayer.Â 

So I just visit [http://chea.niltag.net/McAllenTheDragonSlayer](http://chea.niltag.net/McAllenTheDragonSlayer) and the wiki will ask if you wish to create it.

# Example page markup

Below is example markup. To display unformatted text this way, each line is indented 4 spaces.

For more examples, on the side of each page is a link to view "raw page source." It'll show you exactly what was typed up to produce that page. Markdown is very intuitive.

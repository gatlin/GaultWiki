title: The Untitled Cooperative on Gault Street
...


Welcome! This is a test wiki for the untitled cooperative building on [7910 Gault St][1] in sunny Austin, Texas. We want to build an *open*, *non-discriminatory*, and *democratic* community based on the cooperative ideas of honesty and equality.

But we are far from finished! If you want to **get involved** then look below for more information. The house and this website are works in progress. Stay tuned!

# Welcome!

This is the wiki for [La Reunion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Reunion_%28Dallas%29) cooperative on [7910 Gault St][1] in sunny Austin, Texas. We want to build an *open*, *non-discriminatory*, and *democratic* community based on the cooperative ideas of honesty and equality.

Our mission: To create a cooperative housing community that values and strives to support affordability, equality, empowerment, education and the promotion of the fundamental principles of cooperation, both within the collective and among the wider community. 

We are part of the 501(c)3 nonprofit Community Housing Expansion of Austin (CHEA.)  CHEA was established in 2001 with its first house Sasona.  CHEA is currently composed of Sasona Cooperative and La Reunion Cooperative.

# Next meeting

They normally take place on Sundays at 6 p.m. However, the May 5 meeting will be moved up to 3 p.m. to allow people to attend the screening of <u>Many Hands: Building a Cooperative Future</u>. Also, you can view the [NextAgenda]() ahead of time!

Our property is an apartment complex with 20 two-bedroom units, plus a 3.5-bedroom "manager's suite" that we intend to use as common space.

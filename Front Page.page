The Untitled Cooperative on Gault Street
===

Welcome! This is a test wiki for the untitled cooperative building on [7910 Gault St][1] in sunny Austin, Texas. We want to build an *open*, *non-discriminatory*, and *democratic* community based on the [Rochdale Principles]() of honesty and equality.

But we are far from finished! If you want to **get involved** then click below for more information!

- [Who We Are]()
- The [Rochdale Principles]()
- Our older sibling coop, [Sasona][2]

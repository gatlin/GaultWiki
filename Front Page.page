title: The Untitled Cooperative on Gault Street
...

# Introduction

Welcome! This is a test wiki for the untitled cooperative building on [7910 Gault St][1] in sunny Austin, Texas. We want to build an *open*, *non-discriminatory*, and *democratic* community based on the cooperative ideas of honesty and equality.

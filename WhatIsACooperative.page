title: What is a cooperative?
...

Put simply, a cooperative is a group of people who work together for their common benefit. Cooperatives aim to give people control and responsibility over their own lives. They are communities which value equality, democracy, and freedom.

In most housing cooperatives members eat together, meet regularly, and perform labor. By doing this you remove the need to rent your life from someone else: it's *your* house and *you* take care of it.

# Labor

This can sound off-putting to people who don't live in cooperatives. Labor means maintaining the house: cooking, cleaning, fixing, building, growing, and helping. Many houses assign labor based on preferences and skills and have ways to keep everyone accountable for their responsibilities. Labor is also a fantastic way to learn new skills.

# Equality

In many houses, there are two kinds of members: those who *live* in the cooperative, and those who just *eat* at the cooperative, and they pay different membership fees. As of right now we haven't decided all the different classes of membership we'll have. **One thing is for certain**: all of them get equal votes and equal say in the community.

# The Rochdale Principles

There are seven simple principles which define a cooperative, and how they apply to our new house. 

1. Voluntary and open membership.

    Cooperatives are open to anyone who is willing to accept the responsibilities of membership. We do not discriminate, period. Different houses have different systems for accepting new members but the common theme is that if you are willing to make the effort then your race, religion, country of origin, native language, hair color, clothing, and abilities are welcome to join.

2. Democracy.

    In a cooperative, every member gets a say in house policy and what happens with house resources. There are many different ways for this to work, but above all a cooperative is democratic.

3. Member economic participation.

    Money talks. In a cooperative, the members pay for the house. As a result, the members are the ones who own and control the house. **You** own it and **you** get to decide what you want out of it. No landlords, no "rent"^1^ Cooperators are homeowners, plain and simple.

4. Autonomy and Independence.

    Your house decides what it wants for itself, sets its own rules, and governs itself. If the house wants to purchase eggs from someone, or ally with a service organization, or form any kind of partnership with any other group then it does so at its own will and on its own terms.

    The house is technically part of an organization called Community Housing Expansion of Austin (CHEA). The property itself is owned by a larger organization called NASCO Properties (NP). However, CHEA itself *is* an owner of NP, and a member of CHEA sits on the Board of Directors of NP. Additionally, neither CHEA nor NP have any say in house policy or activity. The result is that we were able to afford to build this cooperative without sacrificing **your** ownership and **your** control.

5. Education, training, and information.

    Cooperation is about empowering people. Education is the most effective way to empower people. Many coops are community centers as well, hosting free classes and seminars on topics the community finds interesting. But cooperatives are educational in other ways. In houses with 20, 40, or even 100 people - and many of those exist in Austin alone - you can learn a lot just by living with the other members. Doing labor teaches people how to cook for lots of people, or to fix mechanical problems, or how to garden, or how to run a meeting, or how to speak in public, *et cetera*. Even the occasional community social party can be educational and informative. And fun!

6. Cooperation among cooperatives.

    A cooperative is a group of people who come together to help each other; cooperatives also try to help each other at a higher level. For example, the Gault house is a 10 minute bike ride from Black Star Pub and Brewery, a cooperative pub owned by its workers and customers. Black Star was created with help from College Houses and ICC, cooperative organizations for students next to the UT campus.

7. Concern for community.

    Cooperatives are not simply about helping their members: they aim to help the community surrounding them, too. We want to take the benefits we get from cooperation and pass them along to as many people as we can. Through education, democracy, economic control, and autonomy, we want to make life better for everyone.

^1^ However, you might hear people refer to their monthly dues as "rent" out of habit. It is after all a very simple word that anyone can spell, and people know what you mean. It should be made clear though that what you are paying are membership dues, not rent.

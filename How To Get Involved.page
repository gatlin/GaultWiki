If you would like to join as a member please e-mail the Membership Coordinator at info@lareunioncoop.org

To join the cooperative for prospective membership we ask that you attend two house meetings, which happen (with dinner served) on Sundays evenings at 6 p.m.  This is so we get to meet you and you can make sure the cooperative is a good fit for you.  If you cannot make this time please let the Membership Coordinator know and we can figure out some other options that fit your schedule.

We plan to offer associate membership for nonresidents in the near future.  Associate members have a vote at house meetings and have access to all the facilities, meals, food, and services as resident members do.

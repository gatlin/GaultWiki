If you would like to join as a member please e-mail the Membership Coordinator at info@lareunioncoop.org

Or, come and talk to us!  Our office hours are currently from 3-5 on Wednesdays and 5-6 on Sundays.  
 
To join the cooperative for prospective membership we ask that you attend two house meetings, which happen (with dinner served) on Sundays evenings at 6 p.m.  This is generally the best time to come visit and get a feel for the house and meet our members.  We encourage you to RSVP to the Membership Coordinator in advance, but we also welcome you to drop by.  If you cannot make this time frame please let the Membership Coordinator know and we can figure out some other options that fit your schedule.

We plan to offer associate membership for nonresidents in the near future.  Associate members have a vote at house meetings and have access to all the facilities, meals, food, and services that resident members do.

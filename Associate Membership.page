Associate members must go through the standard membership acceptance process, and may be denied membership only for the reasons outlined as acceptable for denial of prospective resident members (known history of abusive behavior, past evictions, past nonpayment of rent, etc.)  Unlike resident members, associate members may contract for membership on a month-to-month basis.
 
Associate members may not spend the night in common areas except under extenuating circumstances, such as sickness or inclement weather.  They may not store items in common areas without approval of the house.  Otherwise, associate members have the rights of resident members except where outlined below. 
 
Associate members may join at two tiers.
 
Tier 1:
 
$25 a month, 2 hours of labor a week.  These members have access to the courtyard, garden space, grounds, can run for coordinator positions, and are entitled to full participation at all meetings including a vote.  They are welcome to Sunday potlucks but are not otherwise entitled to common grocery items or meals, unless they pay a donation of $3 per meal.  Food and beverage contributions may also be accepted as a contribution in place of money.  These members may have a commons key but must pay a deposit of $60 to receive one. 
 
Initial costs include $50 nonrefundable membership fee (unless previously paid as a member of another co-op), $25 deposit to be paid at time of contract signing (or $60 if they are to receive a commons key), and $25 before the beginning of their contract.
 
Tier 2:
 
$60 a month, 2 hours of labor a week.  These members have access to the courtyard, garden space, grounds, can run for coordinator positions, and are entitled to full participation all meetings including a vote.  They are entitled to all meals and a reasonable level of personal use of common grocery items.  They can receive a commons key. 
 
Initial costs include $50 nonrefundable NASCO membership fee (unless previously paid as a member of another co-op), $60 refundable deposit to be paid at time of contract signing, and $60 before the beginning of their contract.
 
Members of Other CHEA Houses:
 
Members of other CHEA houses are welcome to come and eat twice a month and/or during all Sunday night potlucks.  To have the rights of associate membership they may pay a discounted rate of $25 for full Tier 2 associate membership, or $10 for Tier 1.  Understanding that members of other houses already have labor obligations, we only require one hour of labor a week from these associates.

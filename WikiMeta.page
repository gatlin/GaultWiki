This page has information on the wiki itself, of technical and historical value.

# Who set this up / who to blame

This wiki was set up by [Gatlin Johnson][shameless]. You can email him at <rokenrol+coopwiki@gmail.com> about anything wiki related, any time.

# The stack

## Gitit

This wiki runs on the fantastic [Gitit][gitit] wiki application. Gitit was chosen primarily because of what it *doesn't* have: it lets you create, edit, and discuss pages; upload files; and customize the look and feel through template files and your own styling information. Tah-dah.

## Git

One neat thing about [Gitit][gitit] is that it stores all wiki data in a git repository. Every time a page is edited, it is committed into the repository. Thanks to magic, the wiki is set up to push to a [backup on GitHub][backup]. This also means re-deployment of the wiki is very simple (see [installing and running the wiki](#how-to-install-and-run-the-wiki)).

## The server

This wiki is currently hosted on a bottom-tier [Linode][linode] server running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The wiki itself is behind an [nginx][nginx] proxy so with a little bit of dancing it is possible to upgrade the server without any downtime.

Note that this wiki can be hosted on any system that can run [Gitit][gitit] so we have a lot of options, not just this particular operating system.

# How to install and run the wiki

This wiki might eventually need to be moved elsewhere. Fortunately, anyone with a little knowledge of git and bash can handle the migration!

## Steps

1. Make sure [git][git] and [gitit][gitit] are installed on your machine.
2. Pick a directory that you want to host the wiki out of (preferably as an unprivileged user). We'll call it `$DIR`.
3. `cd $DIR && git clone git://github.com/gatlin/GaultWiki`. So now you'll have `$DIR/GaultWiki`.
4. `cp GaultWiki/sample.conf myconf.conf` and then edit the file (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
5. In `$DIR`, run `gitit -f myconf.conf`.

**Success!** You might want to run that last step inside [GNU screen][screen] or [tmux][tmux], or append an `&` to run it in the background.

## Users

Gitit stores user credentials in a file called `gitit-users` in the same directory you started it from (if you followed the steps above, then the file is `$DIR/gitit-users`). The passwords are stored hashed, so nothing is stored in cleartext and nobody casually snooping around the files will be able to learn your password.

*However*, it is theoretically possible to take these hashes and crack them (if you are the NSA) so in the interest of providing the absolute best security that I can this file is **not** stored in the git repository.

Instead, I (Gatlin) have it backed up safely and periodically. If you need to re-deploy the system, email me at <rokenrol@gmail.com> and I can get it to you securely. Just move it to `$DIR`, maybe restart the wiki, and you'll have accounts back on line.

## Configuration

There are three configuration fields you care about:

- `port`
- `static-dir`
- `templates-dir`

The `port` field just tells the server which port to listen on. Simple stuff.

The `static-dir` field points to a directory which contains any JavaScript, CSS, or image assets that the site might need (say, for its theme). The [public copy][backup] of the wiki already contains a `static` folder. If you followed the [steps above](#steps), then simply set `static-dir` to `GaultWiki/static`.

The `templates-dir` field points to a directory containing some page templating files. As with `static`, there is already a `templates` directory under `GaultWiki`.

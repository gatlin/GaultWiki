title: Wiki Todo list
...

This wiki itself needs various things done to it to make it more useful and easy to use. As always, feel free to add anything!

- ~~More useful edit sidebar cheat sheet. Lots of space wasted on code formatting.~~
- ~~Wiki data should be backed up to a public git repo.~~
- ~~Explanation of how I set up the wiki as reference.~~ *This exists at [WikiMeta]()*
- Bug: Fancy lists appear to be broken
- Plugin: Turn links to google maps into embedded maps.
- Enhancement: Edit only specific sections.
- Plugin: certain kinds of pages create anchors to specific sections (useful in, say, policy documents)
- Responsive theme.
- Should support OAuth and OpenID for authentication.
- Bug: Export formats should all work :)
- Also for authentication: Mozilla Persona
- Get a namecheap account for CHEA / La Reunion and transfer domain ownership

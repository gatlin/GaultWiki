...

There are a few different mailing lists that members of La Reunion are part of. Each list serves a different purpose so that members can stay up to date on relevant house issues, discuss labor, goof around, etc.

# Member list

The member list, <members@lareunioncoop.org>, is for **general house business**. This means anything that is relevant to important house functions. For example:

- Discussion of upcoming agenda items
- Suggestions for equipment or materials to purchase
- Inquiries about the current budget or any other officer's job

In summary: if you want to talk about house business, email <members@lareunioncoop.org>.

# Labor Talk

The labor talk list, <labor-talk@lareunioncoop.org>, is for all matters involving [Labor](). Email this list if you want to do any of the following:

- Propose a labor task
- Claim a task for credit
- Notify the house that someone did not do a task they signed up for

Additionally, the Labor Czar will respond to messages on this thread to accept, reject, or make labor proposals.

# Fun!

The fun list, <fun@lareunioncoop.org>, is a place to send any off-topic stuff you want to share with the rest of the house. Seriously, go wild. We need more fun in our lives!

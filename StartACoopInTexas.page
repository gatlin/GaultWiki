# Preamble

So you want to start a coop, huh? Awesome! In a perfect world, you'd just go find some property you want and live in harmony with your friends and family.

Unfortunately, we exist in a rather complex system that can be difficult to navigate, and it is (unsurprisingly) not easy to just live in a house with a bunch of people and share stuff. Real estate law, tenants rights, and the tax code are very convoluted and seem deliberately designed to harm normal people. Regrettably you have to deal with mundane, dry legal crap to succeed. Houses have failed before out of simple ignorance of the law.

The good news is that this only has to be figured out once, and it has! You can construct a legal shield of sorts to avoid running afoul of the law.

Please keep in mind: while we will spend a fair amount of time discussing legal bullshit, the most important things in the entire process are your community and the people who comprise it. Everything else is a necessary evil to protect them from the awful Minotaur at the center of this legal labyrinthe. Just follow my rope.

# Part I: Legal Crap

First, let's make sure we know what we're talking about:

## Definitions

Non-profit
:    A type of corporation in Texas which is not created solely to profit its owners.

Tax exempt
:    A federal (not state) term for organizations which do not pay federal taxes.

Cooperative
:    An organization that is owned and run jointly by its members, who share the profits or benefits.

Equity
:    Ownership in any asset after all debts associated with that asset are paid off.

Group equity cooperative
:    A cooperative where the members share the equity as a group.

HOLY BORING BATMAN. Let's take this one step at a time.

## Lay explanation

A cooperative is a non-profit organization which is owned and run by its members. The members pay *dues* to the organization, which the organization uses to provide services for its members. These dues are the organization's income. At the end of the year, any of this income which is not spent is retained by the organization; that's called *equity*. In a *group equity* housing organization, this equity is owned by the organization, not the individual members.

### Why?

1. Liability.
  This setup protects the members of the organization from all kinds of hideous liability. In Texas, if someone is injured on your
property you are liable for damages in court. However if you don't own the property you aren't liable. Instead, the non-profit is liable.

2. Simplicity.
  The members of the organization do not have to worry about anything more complicated than signing a lease. They do not have to invest a lot to buy in and when they leave they simply stop paying their dues.

3. Transparency and community.
  A group-equity cooperative is cooperative in the truest sense: the members pool all their resources together and jointly control what is done with this equity. Nobody is paid anything; rather, the members must use this equity to benefit each other (eg, lowering rent, purchasing better food, expanding into new property, etc).

## How to start a tax-exempt non-profit in the state of Texas

This is a fantastic resource from the Secretary of State Website: [Forming a Nonprofit Tax-Exempt Corporation in Texas][tx501c3]. It has lots of good information.

Additionally you can be automatically-approved for tax-exempt status when filing with the IRS if a certain percentage of your members meet certain income requirements. This is called "safe-harbor."

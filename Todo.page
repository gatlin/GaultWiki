- Be ready to handle maintenance requests BY NEXT WEEK.
- ~~Name the house~~.
- Now that the coop is opening, we should begin discussing the transition from expansion group to house membership.
- Get our budget sorted out.
- ~~Finalize section 8 details.~~ *Totally allowed to accept S8 vouchers and assign labor.*
- Finish our letter to existing tenants, translate it to Spanish, and give it to them.
- Finalize the wording of our Pet Policy.
- Make a tentative plan for cookout/meeting at La Reunion (include in letter?)
- ~~Consolidate our various motions into an easily-referenced policy document.~~ *Sort of done. See [Motions]().*
- Investigate [crowd-funding for solar panels on the roof](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/crowd-funding-clean-energy/?hp).
- Set up mailing lists and officer emails and some kind of shared document storage situation with Google Apps or similar.

Paragraph 1: I'd rather the phrase "with the intention of creating" be replaced with "to create". There will be a co-op, period.

Paragraph 4: I would like to replace the following stretch o' text:

> to give residents responsibility and ownership of the building. In doing this, we create 

with this one:

> to give residents the opportunity to create

Residents will not get ownership beyond its figurative meaning. Best not to confuse at this point.

This is a well-written letter, but its readability score is a bit high. I used [this site](http://www.readability-score.com/) to check it out.

title: Member Acceptance Policy
...

*The following policy was approved by the house, in its entirety, exactly as written below, 8-12-07; revised by house vote on 8-16-09, 8-23-09, 11-21-10, 6-26-11, and 8-5-12. There have been formatting changes for readability.*

# This house has an Open Membership policy.

In order to be accepted as a potential member, prospective members must attend two meetings. (Former members must also attend two meetings and go through the acceptance process again.) The purpose of the two meeting requirement is for the prospective members to get to know the house and vice versa. If someone can’t attend in person, they can attend the meeting by phone. At each meeting, the meeting chair should ask the prospective member if they have any pets – because their pets must also be accepted by the house.

Prospective members must re-apply if they were accepted one year or more previously. In the case that they have to re-apply, they will be given a new spot on the waiting list based on their most recent second meeting.

# The Second Meeting

At the second meeting, all non-members will then be asked to leave the room, and the Meeting Chair will ask, “Does anyone have any compelling evidence of why Fred could be evicted from the house (including for non-payment of rent, abusive behavior, disrupting the right of quiet enjoyment, instilling fear in others, and any other evictable behavior)?” (Evidence includes personal testimony or any other reason one might have.) If no one does, then Fred is accepted as a potential member. He can then sign a contract.

If someone does bring up compelling evidence of why Fred could be evicted, then the meeting will discuss it. (The Membership Coordinator will discreetly inform the prospective member that we are discussing their application; they will be asked to leave and told that we will inform them of our decision as soon as possible. Other non-members will also be asked to leave, after being informed of their acceptance status, so that members can have a private discussion.)

Members can state an objection to the evidence, if the evidence does not seem to be a valid reason that someone could be evicted from the house. If no one objects to the evidence which has been brought up, then the meeting will vote on Fred's membership.

In a member acceptance vote, two people can block a member's acceptance. (Quorum is not required.) If he is not accepted, he cannot sign a contract, and he cannot become a member.

If someone does object to the evidence presented by stating that it is not a valid reason that Fred could be evicted from the house, then the meeting will vote on whether the evidence is valid. A simple majority vote (more than 50%) is required to accept the evidence as valid. If the evidence is accepted as valid, a vote on Fred's membership will take place (which, as described above, can be blocked by two members). If the evidence is not accepted as valid, the vote on Fred's membership will not occur, and Fred will be accepted as a potential member. People who are accepted as members will be put on the ProspectiveMembersWaitingList. When a room is available, all of the members of the house (who can switch rooms if they want) and all people on the waiting list will be alerted. If more than one person is interested in a room, who gets the room needs to be determined.

# Member Acceptance Flow Chart

Here's an attempt to simplify the above policy in a flow chart:

1. The Meeting Chair asks, “Does anyone have any compelling evidence of why Fred could be evicted from the house (including for non-payment of rent, abusive behavior, disrupting the right of quiet enjoyment, instilling fear in others, and any other evictable behavior)?”

    (a) No one presents any compelling evidence. Fred is accepted.
    (b) Someone presents compelling evidence. Go to 2. 

2. The Meeting Chair will ask if anyone objects to the evidence which has been presented.

    (a) No one objects to the evidence that has been presented. Go to 4.
    (b) Someone objects to the evidence that has been presented. Go to 3. 

3. The meeting will vote on whether the evidence is valid.

    (a) More than 50% vote that the evidence is valid. Go to 4.
    (b) 50% or less vote that the evidence is valid. Fred is accepted. 

4. A vote is taken on whether to accept Fred as a member.

    (a) Less than two people vote to block Fred's acceptance. Fred is accepted.
    (b) Two or more people vote to block Fred's acceptance. Fred is not accepted. 

# Additional Meetings

At any point in the process, a simple majority vote (more than 50%) can require additional membership meetings to further discuss the member's potential acceptance. (Quorum is not required.) This can be used in complicated cases, or in situations where more evidence needs to be gathered or additional persons need to be at the meeting to give their points of view.
